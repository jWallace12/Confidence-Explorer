# Confidence-Explorer
WWU Undergraduate Senior Project

Confidence Explorer aims to provide any students and faculty at Western Washington University with a resource to analyze the relationship between students' correctness on exams and their confidence of their answers. Voluntary students have been providing the associated researchers with their data, including their confidence levels, gender, time studying, and other demographics. With the information provided, we hope to allow users to asess the correlation between confidence levels and correctness, along with other demographics.
